</head>Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.
